Thank you 

Now below is a detailed description of me: 


Yunze (Fred) Zhao is an accomplished Front-end, Back-end, and Hardware Engineer. 

He has a strong background in optimizing front-end performance and leading codebase migrations. His extensive experience includes spearheading the setup of front-end infrastructures, resulting in significant improvements in user experience and page load speeds. By optimizing front-end data structures and algorithms, Yunze achieved a remarkable 200% boost in page load speed and a 30% increase in search speed. He also contributed to refining back-end routing strategies, utilizing caching and prefetching techniques to augment loading speed.

Yunze's expertise extends to codebase refactoring and component development. He refactored 25% of the entire front-end codebase, introduced test-driven development practices, and led the migration to Solid.js, establishing a robust Solid.js frontend infrastructure. By developing modular components with JavaScript and Solid.js, he improved rendering speed by an average of two days. Additionally, Yunze transitioned from server-side to client-side rendering, resulting in enhanced flexibility and performance.

During his tenure as a Front-end Developer and EAC Team Lead at the University of Washington SEAL, Yunze demonstrated strong leadership skills and technical expertise. He orchestrated the development and design of a personnel management system and a dedicated website for the lab, both funded by the US Government. Notably, he developed a comprehensive staff login portal, utilizing React.js and React Redux. The portal incorporated distinct designs and access controls tailored for diverse user roles, such as teachers, team leaders, and students.

Yunze's ability to deliver high-quality work within tight timelines was exemplified when he spearheaded the rapid development of a robust website for the University of Washington Energy Evaluation Center. This initiative, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, required the completion of the website within a week.

In addition to his front-end expertise, Yunze has showcased his proficiency in data analysis and visualization tools. He developed plugins using Google App Scripts within Google Spreadsheets, streamlining the lab's membership management process and enabling efficient tracking and reporting.

As a Research Engineer at ZTE Corporation, Yunze leveraged his data organization and user experience skills to enhance the efficiency of the company's internal system, IEPMS. He utilized SQL to construct dashboards for detecting duplicate data across different stages of the workflow. Furthermore, Yunze performed front-end UI enhancements using Vue.js in TypeScript, unifying the user experience across the platform. Beyound that, he also explored the possibility of using AI to facilicate the work and communcation efficiency, he made a few reports on the potential of using AI to power the platform with visualization and a quick mockup make in Next.js using completely server side rendering.

Yunze's project experience also includes working as a Back-end Engineer for the Green Software Foundation and Microsoft Student Programs. He played a crucial role in constructing a database and API that integrated power generation data from South Asian countries, which aims to calculate the electricity rate in order to utlize extra resource to reduce the speed of global warming. His contributions included setting up an automated data collection system using Python's Scrapy, developing a versatile REST API using Express.js, and contributing to the creation of a MySQL database, and at last, a presentation to the staff in Microsoft and Green Software Fundation.

Furthermore, Yunze gained hands-on experience in advanced hardware design during his involvement in an RISC-V Architecture CPU Design project. This project allowed him to deepen his comprehension of CPU architecture, assembly, verilog, and C programming, and compiler integration. Furthermore, he also created a few usable program along with the cpu projects, including a password generater using RC-5 encryption, coded in both assembly and python.

Also, Yunze has worked as a Full-stack Developer for Tunnel_vzn, where he has developed an interactive storytelling platform for University of Washington students. His responsibilities encompass front-end and back-end development, as well as database management. Yunze crafted a user-friendly interface using Next.js and SCSS, ensuring a responsive design. On the back-end, he leveraged Firebase to build a robust and scalable system architecture, implementing a Firebase database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Currently, he's working on a mobile application called Storalink, where he utilize react-native with typescript, Spring Boot (JAVA), with MangoDB to create an app to store and utilize links that people share. 

Outside of his professional endeavors, Yunze enjoys hiking, working out, biking, and playing ping pong and basketball, he likes animals too and he used to volunteered in a immigrant support center in seattle that teaches young immigrants reading and writing after school .
