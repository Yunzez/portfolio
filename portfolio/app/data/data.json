      "details": "As a key member of the OpenTug team, I worked extensively on both the front-end and back-end, leading the charge in setting up the front-end infrastructure and initiating the transition of the codebase from jQuery to Solid.js. This transition allowed us to improve our overall software development process and streamline our work. I took the lead in redesigning, simplifying, and restructuring numerous web pages, focusing on core business pages such as the Sailings Map page, the Book a Sailing page, and the Post a Sailing page. Through these efforts, we were able to increase frontend efficiency by at least 30%. I achieved this by utilizing the powerful capabilities of Figma to redesign most of the pages, allowing for a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. Notably, I also designed a range of reusable components using Solid.js. These include an auto-routing algorithm and a weather widget, which enhanced the functionality and user interaction of our website. Additionally, I introduced a set routing checking algorithm and managed to modularize Google Map API. By separating its marker and map components, I made markers reusable, further enhancing our site's usability. As part of my backend work, I provided key recommendations such as combining endpoints to reduce confusion and simplifying the data model where possible. I also advocated for the implementation of an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) as a crucial tool for onboarding. I believed it was equally important to provide a user interface for all API endpoints, ensuring smoother interactions and more efficient data handling. These suggestions significantly improved our back-end operations and overall team productivity."
